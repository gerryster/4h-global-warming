         <p>
        When climate change heats up the planet ice caps will melt resulting in the ice capes to go turn into water. When the ice caps turn into water the ocean will rise and cause flooding. flooding can kill people, destroy buildings, and many more; because flooding will destroy buildings it could be expensive for people.
