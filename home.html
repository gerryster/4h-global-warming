            <li> Extreme Climate </li>
        </ol>

            Some things we can do stop climate change are, save power, get solar panels, and switch our energy source to a renewable and clean energy source. We can also plant trees and other plants. Planting stuff can help with climate change because trees use CO<sub>2</sub> to breathe and when the trees breath out they release oxygen.
