        <h2>Why I Made This Site</h2>
        <p>
            I made this site because I wanted to inform people about the dangers of global warming. I hope that the people who read this site can use this information and do something to stop global warming. My hope is some day in the future is we can all work together to stop global warming. I think global warming is a very scary thing and if we don't do something about we could face some very serous consequences.
